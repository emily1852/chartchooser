# chartchooser
Helps people new to visual analytics choose the chart that's best for their data and their audience

Developed by Emily Kund, a Principal Business Intelligence Engineer at Red Hat, a master trainer, accessibility advocate, and a data visualization leader. 

<h2>
Who's it for?

<body>
The chart chooser is for someone who is new to visual analytics and may not know what kind of chart is appropriate for their data or their audience.  By using the chart chooser, a developer can prototype more easily and develop more rapidly. The end result is a char that your audience can understand, which helps them take a data informed action (like a decision or ask a question).

<h2>
Why was the chart chooser developed?

<body>
The chart chooser was developed because Emily's own experience and the experience of the 100s others that she has trained demonstrated that a lot of people are introduced to data visualization without a deep knowledge of the subject.  It's not just about making charts look pretty. With the chart chooser, it's the goal that the while people are learning more about data visualization, they can make good decisions about what charts to use.
